["God Save the Queen" is playing, while actor Mathew Rushmere, dressed as Queen Elizabeth II makes his entrance.]

2
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Thank you, you can sit down.

3
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Is it on?
[Voice from Off] Yes!
[Mathew] Good.

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Our dearest European neighbours,

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I am speaking to you today from my royal residence,

6
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Mock-Buckingham Palace in Central London, post Brexit,

7
00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Just to let you all know…
(starts sobbing)
…how well the United Kingdom is doing.

8
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
(starts crying)

9
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Just in case you wonder,

10
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I feel that at this point, there are a few rumours

11
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that I should clarify that have been circulating the airwaves since our independence — yesterday.

12
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It is categorically untrue

13
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that I have sold the crown jewels to Cash for Gold.

14
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
For the Arab Sheik made a far more interesting offer.

15
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And it is a horrid lie

16
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that there is a Burger King set up right here in Buckingham Palace.

17
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
McDonald's had that space booked years ago.

18
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
One is loving it.
